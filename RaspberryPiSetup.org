You'll see this file when Emacs is starting up for the first time on your Raspberry Pi.

Here are some things to remember:
- Set up audio output correctly by right-clicking the volume icon in the top right and selecting 'AV Jack'.
- To run EXWM as the default window manager, add the following to =~/.xsession= by running =C-c C-v t= in this buffer:

#+begin_src shell :tangle ~/.xsession

  sh ~/Documents/config/exwm/start-exwm.sh

#+end_src
