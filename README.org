* qucchia/dotfiles

This is my desktop configuration, using Emacs and EXWM on a Raspberry Pi.

Most of the configuration is made under the =org-files= folder using Org mode files, which are then tangled with Org Babel and finally symlinked with GNU Stow to the home directory so Emacs and other programs can read them. Files in the =root= file are stowed to the filesystem root instead.

* Installation

*Requirements*: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]].

To install the repo to the =.dotfiles= folder and set up all the symlinks:

#+begin_src shell

  git clone https://codeberg.org/qucchia/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  stow .
  sudo stow root -t /

#+end_src

* Summary

Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the files in the =org-files= folder.

- =Emacs.org= is the main file for my Emacs configuration. It also loads the configuration from:
  - =Dolly.org=, which contains some functions to use the Tor proxy in Emacs.
  - =Dotty.org=, which is a package for automating actions in this =dotfiles= repository.
  - =Racket.org=, which plays a different Star Wars soundtrack depending on the day of the week.
  - =Email.org= is currently unused.
    
- =Desktop.org= is the configuration for EXWM.

- =Browser.org= is the configuration for Vimb.

Some other directories and files worth noting:
- =.bin/= contains custom bash commands which are loaded in =.profile=.
- =root/= is stowed to the filesystem root.
- =setup/= contains some self-notes for setup on a new machine and some pre-made Firefox configuration.
- =.xmodmap= maps Caps Lock to Left Super and the key between Left Shift and Z to Escape.
- =.xsession= starts EXWM.
