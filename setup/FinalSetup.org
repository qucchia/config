#+title:Raspberry Pi Final Setup

You'll see this file when Emacs is starting up for the first time on your Raspberry Pi.

Here are some things to remember:

* Install icons

You'll have to restart Emacs for the changes to take effect.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (all-the-icons-install-fonts)

#+end_src

* Set up audio output

By default, the audio output is set to HDMI. To change it to the headphone jacks, follow these steps:
1. Run =lxsession= on eshell.
2. Find the volume icon > Default Sink > Built-in Audio Analog Stereo.
3. Kill =lxsession=.
